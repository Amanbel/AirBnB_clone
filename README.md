# AirBnb clone Project

## What is AirBnb
we are trying to build a clone of the website airbnb to do that we have been instructed with steps to achive our end result
when we ask "what is AirBnb?" AirBnb is a service that lets property owners rent out their spaces to travelers looking for a place to stay.
by the definition you can understand the website has many intrecate and complex functions and data manegment, we here at Alx are going to implement
this functions and make a working and functioning service.

## How to build it

### the console
the console is, if we are taking the definition of google,Logs information associated with a web page: 
network requests, JavaScript, CSS, security errors and warnings as well as error, 
warning and informational messages explicitly logged by JavaScript code running in the page context.
the console is basicly a command interpreter to manipulate a storage system to create, distroy and update data, it also helps us to
store and persist objects to a file(JSON file) this helps us in the abstraction of the process between our object and how it is stored and persisted.

### how to use the console
we build the console from a class inheriting from the cmd.Cmd class this helps us access all the methods 
we need to interact with our code as a command interpreter, there are many methods the are needed in the class
for example:

* do_quit
* do_emptyline
* do_EOF

with this methods we can get the basic functionality of the console
